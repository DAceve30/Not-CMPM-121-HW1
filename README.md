# Description

This is a scene of an apartment with two characters watching an old TV. Being an apartment, the scene contains some furniture and not much else. There wasn't really anything that inspired me in particular, but I felt like it would be an easy scene to learn the ropes of Unity. The main character of this scene should be the red character.

## List of Objects & Sources

- Lamp, Computer, Flatscreen TV, Desk, Chair, Bed, Bedside Table, Refridgerator, Room Walls/Floor/Ceiling, and Skybox Texture/Material
